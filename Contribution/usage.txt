USAGE OF CONTRIBUTION ENGINE:

To update the system - somehow run this method.  
***** Contribution::ContributionEngine::generateAnnualAnniversaryContributions() *****

It relies on objects, so maybe run it from eclispe locally?

It takes a minute to chug along with a lot of data, but it did generate the data on my local testing

One drawback is that it does not use transactions, so it creates a new Connection for every db record added.
Not good!

It also relies on using database MySQL where datetime/timestamp is in form '2013-10-10 11:24:53',
and date '2013-10-10'

Don't forget the SQL script has changed:
ALTER TABLE contributions MODIFY charity_id INT null;
